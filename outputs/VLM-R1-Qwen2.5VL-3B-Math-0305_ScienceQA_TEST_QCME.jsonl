{"id": "609", "response": "<think>\nTo determine the probability that a rabbit produced by this cross will have brown fur, we need to analyze the Punnett square provided. The Punnett square shows the possible combinations of alleles that can be inherited from the two parents.\n\nThe Punnett square is as follows:\n\n|       | F | f |\n|-------|---|---|\n| F     | FF | Ff |\n| f     | Ff | ff |\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see that there are four possible genotypes for the offspring:\n- FF (black fur)\n- Ff (black fur)\n- Ff (black fur)\n- ff (brown fur)\n\nOut of these four possible genotypes, only one (ff) results in brown fur. Therefore, the probability of a rabbit having brown fur is the number of ff genotypes divided by the total number of possible genotypes.\n\nProbability = Number of ff genotypes / Total number of genotypes\nProbability = 1 / 4\n\nTherefore, the probability that a rabbit produced by this cross will have brown fur is 1/4.\n</think>\n<answer>\nE. 1/4\n</answer>"}
