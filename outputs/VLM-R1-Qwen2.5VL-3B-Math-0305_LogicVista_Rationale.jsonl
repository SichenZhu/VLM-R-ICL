A BarBox is £0.50 cheaper than buying the individual Bars separately.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that FruitBars are sold twice as often as OatBars. This means if OatBars are sold 10 times, FruitBars are sold 20 times.\n\nFrom point 4, we know that a BarBox combines two of each bar type. This means if we sell 10 BarBoxes, we sell 20 FruitBars and 20 OatBars.\n\nFrom point 5, we know that half of OatBars sales are sold through BarBoxes. This means if we sell 10 BarBoxes, we sell 20 OatBars.\n\nFrom point 6, we know that a BarBox is £0.50 cheaper than buying the individual Bars separately. This means the cost of a BarBox is the cost of 2 FruitBars and 2 OatBars minus £0.50.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of a BarBox:\n- The cost of 2 FruitBars is 2 * £1.75 = £3.50.\n- The cost of 2 OatBars is 2 * £1.75 = £3.50.\n- The total cost of 2 FruitBars and 2 OatBars is £3.50 + £3.50 = £7.00.\n- The cost of a BarBox is £7.00 - £0.50 = £6.50.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of selling 10 BarBoxes:\n- The cost of 10 BarBoxes is 10 * £6.50 = £65.00.\n\nThe total cost of selling 10 BarBoxes is £65.00, which is the same as the cost of selling 20 FruitBars and 20 OatBars separately.

The stability of a parcel depends on how easily it can be rotated about its pivot points. In this case, the pivot points are the ends of the ropes to which the parcels are attached.\n\n- **Parcel A**: The pivot point is at the edge of the parcel, which means it is very stable because it requires a significant force to rotate it.\n- **Parcel B**: The pivot point is also at the edge of the parcel, but it is less stable because it is closer to the center of mass, making it more susceptible to rotation.\n- **Parcel C**: The pivot point is at the edge of the parcel, similar to Parcel A, but it is less stable because it is closer to the center of mass, making it more susceptible to rotation.\n\nTherefore, Parcel A is the most stable because it has the pivot points at the edges of the parcel, making it less likely to rotate.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA.\n</answer>"}

Calculate the production in July:\n   - January production: 18,000 barrels\n   - Reduction in production: 22%\n   - Production in July = 18,000 × (1 - 0.22) = 18,000 × 0.78 = 14,040 barrels\n\nNow, let's move to the second step:\n\n2. Multiply the July production by the average barrel price for July:\n   - Average barrel price for July: $82\n   - July production: 14,040 barrels\n   - July production value = 14,040 × $82 = $1,151,280\n\nTherefore, the value of oil produced in July is $1,151,280.\n</think>\n<answer>\nD\n</answer>"}

{"id": "443", "response": "<think>\nThe problem involves comparing the surface area of different metal grids to determine which one would be most likely to sink when placed on a surface of water. The key factor here is the surface area, as it affects the buoyancy of the grid. Grid A has the smallest surface area, while grid D has the largest surface area. According to the principle of buoyancy, a larger surface area will allow a grid to float more easily because it can displace more water. Conversely, a smaller surface area will make it more likely to sink because it can displace less water.\n\nTherefore, grid A, which has the smallest surface area, would be most likely to sink first.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA.\n</answer>"}
{"id": "434", "response": "<think>\nIn the given cog and belt system, the cogs are arranged in a way that each cog is connected to the next one in a chain. When a cog moves in one direction, the adjacent touching cog will move in the opposite direction. This means that if one cog is moving clockwise, the next one will be moving counterclockwise, and so on.\n\nGiven that there are 10 cogs in total, and each cog is connected to the next one, we can deduce that the cogs will alternate between clockwise and counterclockwise motion. Since the first cog is moving clockwise, the second one will be moving counterclockwise, the third one will be moving clockwise, and so on.\n\nTo find out how many cogs will be moving counterclockwise, we can divide the total number of cogs by 2.

{"id": "421", "response": "<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the principle of moments (torque) in a lever system. The principle states that for a system to be in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments must equal the sum of the counterclockwise moments.\n\nIn this scenario, the weight B is supported by the string at point A. When point A is moved, the moment (torque) created by the weight B will change. The moment is calculated as the force (weight) times the distance from the pivot point (A).\n\nGiven that the weight B needs to be raised by 12 cm, we need to determine how far point A needs to be moved to achieve this. Since the weight B is directly proportional to the distance from the pivot point A, and the distance from A to B is the same for both weights, the distance A needs to be moved is the same as the distance B needs to be raised.\n\nTherefore, if B needs to be raised by 12 cm, point A must also be moved by 12 cm to maintain equilibrium.\n</think>\n<answer>\nE\n</answer>"}

{"id": "445", "response": "<think>\nTo determine which sign is the least likely to fall over from a powerful wind, we need to consider the aerodynamic properties of each sign. The aerodynamic stability of an object depends on its shape and the presence of holes or protrusions that can disrupt airflow.\n\n1. **Shape and Holes**: The shape of the sign and the presence of holes can significantly affect its aerodynamic stability. For example, a hexagonal shape with a hole might have different airflow patterns compared to a square or rectangular shape with a hole.\n\n2. **Randomness**: The signs are not to scale, and the holes are randomly positioned and shaped. This makes it impossible to definitively determine which sign is the least likely to fall over based on the given information.\n\n3. **Aerodynamic Flow**: The airflow around each sign would be influenced by its shape and the presence of holes. However, without specific measurements or a detailed analysis of the airflow patterns, it is challenging to determine which sign would be the least affected by wind.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is that it is impossible to tell which sign is the least likely to fall over from a powerful wind.\n</think>\n<answer>\nE\n</answer>"}

If we assume the total number of shares is 100, then Directors own 16 shares. The table shows that Directors held 1,100 shares at the start of 2009, 1,050 shares at the end of 2009, and 910 shares at the end of May 2009. The total number of shares held by Directors is 3,060, not 4,870. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(D) Tobey Gilham held the most shares of any Director on 1st April 2009.\n- The table shows that Tobey Gilham had 1,050 shares at the start of 2009, which is the most among the Directors. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n(E) Each Director has less shares on 31 May 2009 compared to 1st April 2009.\n- The table shows that Trudy Stupples has more shares on 31 May 2009 (2,400) than she had at the start of 2009 (1,200). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the evaluations, the correct answer is (B) The largest Director share dealing was 1,440 shares.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB\n</answer>"}

{"id": "424", "response": "<think>\nThe outer ring A is rotating at 5 RPM. Since A has 100 teeth, the circumference of A is 100 teeth * 360 degrees / 100 teeth = 360 degrees. The circumference of A is also equal to the distance traveled by the center of A in one revolution. The center of A is 100 teeth away from the center of B, so the distance traveled by the center of A in one revolution is 100 teeth * 360 degrees / 100 teeth = 360 degrees. The circumference of B is 20 teeth * 360 degrees / 20 teeth = 360 degrees. The circumference of B is also equal to the distance traveled by the center of B in one revolution. The center of B is 20 teeth away from the center of C, so the distance traveled by the center of B in one revolution is 20 teeth * 360 degrees / 20 teeth = 360 degrees. The circumference of C is 25 teeth * 360 degrees / 25 teeth = 360 degrees. The circumference of C is also equal to the distance traveled by the center of C in one revolution. The center of C is 25 teeth away from the center of the shaft, so the distance traveled by the center of C in one revolution is 25 teeth * 360 degrees / 25 teeth = 360 degrees. The distance traveled by the center of A in one revolution is equal to the distance traveled by the center of B in one revolution, which is equal to the distance traveled by the center of C in one revolution. Therefore, the shaft is rotating at 5 RPM. Since the center of A is moving clockwise, the center of B must also be moving clockwise, so the center of C is moving anti-clockwise.
